## Resignation

At any time Aragon Cooperative members can leave the organization. They can do so by creating an Issue in the temp repo titled "Resignation: @member-id-on-keybase". The Resigation Issue must answer the following questions:
- What was your intention joining the Aragon Cooperative?
- What was your experince like overall with the Aragon Cooperative?
- Why are you leaving the Aragon Cooperative?
- What suggestions for improvement would you recommend for the Aragon Cooperative?

After creating this Resignation Issue, members can then create a vote on the Ethereum mainnet Aragon Cooperative DAO to remove themselves as members. This vote must reference the Issue number, the members Keybase account ID, and the reason for leaving.
