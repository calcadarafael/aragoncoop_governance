<p align='center'>How people become members of the Aragon Cooperative</p>

<br>

## Motivation

- The current process doesnâ€™t work
- One person responsible 
- avoid consuming too much bandwidth 

<br>

## Protocol

### 1. Contributor signals intent to become a member by creating a Membership Request Issue in the temp repo

The Membership Request must answer the following questions:
- Why do you want to join the Aragon Cooperative?
- How do you plan on contributing to the mission/objectives of the Aragon Cooperative?
- What have you done so far to demonstrate the above intent?

This Issues will then be up for discussion. Once rough consensus is reached that the Aragon Cooperative supports adding this member, an official Application For Membership can be created.

### 2. Contributor makes an Application For Membership

This involves creating a vote on the mainnet Aragon Cooperative DAO. The vote must reference the Issue #, name of the new member on Keybase, and the member's Ethereum address to mint a new membership token to.

### 3. Current Members can then vote to mint a new MBR token for the contributor or not

This vote can only happen on the Ethereum mainnet Aragon Cooperative DAO

## Criteria

Guidelines on assessing potential members.


### Community Profile 

How active have they been in other online communities, can they evidence value add to another community

### Conduct 
 
Is there any evidence their conduct elsewhere has been problematic? Have they exhibited behaviours contrary to our CoC?


### Refernces

Has the member been recommended by a current member of the group?
