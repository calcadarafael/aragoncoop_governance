# Coop on boarding protocol

* This protocol != strategy
* need a separate engagement strategy with positive feedback loops
* Simply the rules of joining coop

## Motivation

- Current process doesn’t work
- One person responsible [bottleneck, centralized]
- avoid consuming too much bandwidth 


## Proposals
There are a number of ways we can do this, and we need buy in from the whole community. I have outlined a range of possible protocols, any other suggestions welcome.

### Proposal 1:  Membership Working Group

1. Contributor signals intent to become a member
2. Contributor enters a probationary period
3. Contributor makes an application to for membership
4. After earning x MRT members collectively make a desisition to mint (or not) a new MBR token for the contributor

##### Pros


##### Cons
- Too much power for some members
- increases complexity

### Proposal 2:  Permissionless Veto
Anyone can become a member without permission, however any current member has the right to veto

1. Contributor signals intent to become a member
2. Contributor enters a probationary period
3. Contributor mints token -> vote 
4. Voting starts with a long delay (4 weeks?)
5. Unless challenged MBR is minted


##### Pros


##### Cons
- Still requires at least one person to make sure no one fly’s under the radar [not a big issue, if bylaws pass]

### Proposal 3:  low turnout Veto
Anyone can become a member with the permission of a few members (1-x) approval, however any current member has the right to veto

1. Contributor signals intent to become a member
2. Contributor looks for support of members
3. Contributor mints token -> vote 
4. Voting starts with a normal delay, in normal voting cycle
5. If yes == x && no < 1: MBR is minted


##### Pros
- Best balance of bandwith/permissionlessness [even a word?!]/safety


##### Cons
- Technically may be more challenging

### Proposal 4:  simple majority


1. Contributor signals intent to become a member
2. Contributor looks for support of members
3. Contributor mints token -> vote 
4. Voting starts with a normal delay, in normal voting cycle
5. If yes > 51% MBR is minted


##### Pros


##### Cons
