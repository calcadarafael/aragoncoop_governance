# Coop onboarding protocol

* This protocol != strategy
* need a separate engagement strategy with positive feedback loops
* Simply the rules of joining the coop

## Motivation

- The current process doesnâ€™t work
- One person responsible 
- avoid consuming too much bandwidth 

## Protocol

1. Contributor signals intent to become a member
2. Contributor enters a probationary period [what does this look like, seems like probation should be after voted in if any, comments/opinions]
3. Contributor makes an application for membership
4. After [....] members collectively make a decision to decide not) a new MBR token for the contributor

### Questions for candidates
* why do they want to join?
* how do they plan on contributing to the mission/objectives of the group?
* what have they done so far to demonstrate the above intent?


### Criteria
* When assessing a potential member, what are the criteria?

- contribution: 
since AGP40 references 
> methods for community members to gain meaningful involvement within Aragon beyond forum/chat contributions

It makes sense meaningful contribution beyond chat should be a criteria [opinions?]

- outside community profile: 
how active have they been in other online communities, can they evidence value add to another community

- conduct: 
is there any evidence their conduct elsewhere has been problematic? Have they exhibited behaviours contrary to our CoC?

- Nomination: 
must be nominated, similar to Moloch [
Maybe this is too much?]
